ðŸ§© Sliding Window Exercise â€” Max Subarray Sum
Description:
Implement a method that receives an array of integers and a number k, and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size k.
If k is greater than the length of the array or is non-positive, return -1.
Your implementation must use the Sliding Window technique.

âœ… Sample Input and Output:
Input: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3 â†’ Output: 9
(Explanation: max sum is from subarray [5,1,3])

Input: [2, 3], k = 3 â†’ Output: -1
(Explanation: subarray size larger than array)

Input: [4, 2, 1, 7, 8, 1, 2, 8, 1, 0], k = 3 â†’ Output: 16
(Explanation: [7,8,1] and [8,1,2] both sum to 16)

ðŸ§ª Interface & Naming Requirements
Your class must be named MyMaxSubarraySum

You must implement the following method:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public interface IMaxSubarraySum
{
    int MaxSum(int[] array, int k);
}
